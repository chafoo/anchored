# Task-file schema — v2 (YAML)

The on-disk format for `.claude/tasks/<slug>.yml`. This document is
the human-readable spec; the machine-readable spec is the Zod schema
at `mcp/src/schema/task-file-v2.ts` and its derived JSON Schema at
`dist/schema/task-file-v2.schema.json`. The two MUST stay in sync —
when in doubt, the Zod schema wins.

## Why YAML

v0.1 used custom markdown with line-based regex parsing. Two bug
classes shipped (missing H1 → manual recovery; multi-line evidence
→ silent AC loss). Both are structurally impossible in v2 — the
`yaml` package handles edge cases the regex parser missed.

The mental model is the same one used by Kubernetes manifests,
GitHub Actions workflows, Ansible playbooks, GitLab CI configs, and
docker-compose: **structured workflow definition with embedded
prose**. Markdown content (context intro, plan notes, evidence
strings) still works — it lives inside YAML string values, with `|`
block scalars preserving multi-line content verbatim.

## Full structure

```yaml
schema_version: 2                    # literal; v2-only parser refuses other values

status: plan | build | wrap | done   # next-action lifecycle marker

### `acceptance_criteria[]`

| Field      | Type   | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `evidence` | string | Either the em-dash sentinel `"—"` (unfilled) or a concrete reference (file:line, command + outcome, test name + result, commit SHA). Service-layer rejects writes with embedded newlines. |

## State machine

### Task status

```
plan → build → wrap → done
```

- Forward-only. `task.status.set("plan")` from `build` is illegal.
- Stay-in-place transitions (X → X) are idempotent no-ops (allowed).
- `build → wrap` requires every phase to be terminal
  (`done | blocked | deferred`). The service-layer throws
  `IncompletePhases` otherwise.

### Phase status

```
pending → in-progress → done | blocked | deferred
                  ↑              ↓
                  └──── blocked (retry path) ←──
```

- `pending → in-progress` — start work on the phase
- `pending → deferred` — explicitly defer without working
- `in-progress → done` — service-layer rejects unless every AC has
  non-sentinel evidence (`IncompleteEvidence`)
- `in-progress → blocked` — work attempted but couldn't finish
- `blocked → in-progress` / `blocked → pending` — retry path

`done` and `deferred` are terminal — no transitions out.

## Service-layer enforcement (USP)

The on-disk file is mutated exclusively through service-layer ops
(MCP tools `mcp__task__*` for agents, `anchored` CLI for shells).
The service-layer enforces:

| Gate                                      | Op                              | Throws                |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Forward-only task lifecycle               | `task.status.set`               | `InvalidTransition`   |
| Valid phase lifecycle                     | `phase.status.set`              | `InvalidTransition`   |
| Phase done ⇔ all ACs have real evidence   | `phase.status.set("done")`      | `IncompleteEvidence`  |
| Task wrap ⇔ all phases terminal           | `task.status.set("wrap")`       | `IncompletePhases`    |
| Evidence non-empty, no newlines           | `ac.evidence.set`               | `InvalidEvidence`     |
| AC index in range                         | `ac.evidence.set`               | `OutOfRange`          |
| Phase extension declared in anchored.yml  | `phase.field.set`               | `UnknownField`        |
| Extension value matches declared type     | `phase.field.set`               | `InvalidFieldType`    |

**Zero bootstrap exceptions** — see
`plugin/references/state-mutations.md`. Every mutation, including the
initial creation of a task-file by plan-agent and the Q&A
resolutions during /impl-plan, goes through the MCP factory. No
agent in `plugin/agents/*` has `Write` or `Edit` in its
frontmatter (enforced by the
`mcp/tests/agent-frontmatter.test.ts` test).

## IDE validation

Point your editor's `yaml-language-server` at the published JSON
Schema for real-time validation while editing task-files by hand:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=./dist/schema/task-file-v2.schema.json
```

The schema is exported on every build and lives in
`@anchored/mcp/dist/schema/task-file-v2.schema.json` (path adjusted
for your install location). When the plugin is installed via
marketplace, this resolves to the global node_modules location.

## Migrating from v1

Run `anchored migrate <slug>` to convert a v1 `.md` task-file to a
v2 `.yml` task-file. The command is idempotent (re-runs on already-
converted files are safe no-ops). Use `anchored migrate --all` to
convert every `.md` file under `.claude/tasks/` in one pass.

Migration preserves: frontmatter (slug, status, created), title,
context sub-sections (intro, plan, build H4 sub-sections, wrap intro
+ sub-sections), phases (name, slug, status, optional context,
optional rules, acceptance_criteria with text + evidence), and
extension fields (commit, coverage_pct, etc.) — these last flatten
from v1's `extensions:` envelope to v2's top-level passthrough keys.
